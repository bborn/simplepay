    ##
    # The Amazon Simple Pay Donation service is used to facilitate the collection 
    # of donations to your organization, or another's organization via the 
    # marketplace functionality.  When used through the marketplace functionality,
    # you may charge a commission fee for brokering the exchange.
    # 
    # Note that donation recipients must accept your marketplace fee policy before
    # the payment buttons for their donations may be generated.   This can be 
    # accomplished using the +MarketplacePolicy+ service with the form helper 
    # (see examples).
    #
