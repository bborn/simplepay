    ##
    # The Amazon Simple Pay Marketplace service is used to facilitate payments for others.
    # Use it to charge a commission fee for brokering the exchange between buyers and sellers.
    #
    # Note that sellers must accept your marketplace fee policy before the payment buttons
    # for their products can be generated. This can be accomplished using the +MarketplacePolicy+
    # service with the form helper (see examples).
